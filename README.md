# DeepMedicBMet
## Deep learning for brain metastasis detection and segmentation in longitudinal MRI data
This is the official code repository for our Medical Physics paper "Deep learning for brain metastasis detection and segmentation in longitudinal MRI data": https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.15863

## This is the original DeepMedic with our proposed VSS loss for brain metastasis identification without prior volumes (the version with the additional prior path is in [DeepMedicPlus](https://github.com/YixingHuang/DeepMedicPlus)).
 
 The backbone of our implementation is from the [original DeepMedic repository](https://github.com/deepmedic/deepmedic). Therefore, almost all the instructions from the original DeepMedic repository still apply to our implementation.

## Contents
This repository contains our DeepMedic+ implementation with prior volumes and proposed volume-level sensitivity-specificity (VSS) loss, as well as the pretrained high-sensitivity and high-precision model weights.
For retraining on your own datasets, our preprocessing pipeline is also shared.

#### VSS loss
The VSS loss is located at [here](https://github.com/YixingHuang/DeepMedicBMet/blob/main/deepmedic/neuralnet/cost_functions.py).

#### Pretrained models
Pretrained models are located at 
[DeepMedicDualPath\examples\output\saved_models\pretrainedModels](./DeepMedicPlus/examples/output/saved_models/pretrainedModels/)

The high sensitivity model is: deepMedicWide1.high_sensitivity.model.ckpt  
The high precision model is: deepMedicWide1.high_precision.model.ckpt

#### Data structure for inference/test
Put the main test volume paths in [.\examples\configFiles\deepMedicPlus\test\testChannels_t1c.cfg](./DeepMedicPlus/examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/test/testChannels_t1c.cfg)  

put the corresponding prior volume paths in [.\examples\configFiles\deepMedicPlus\test\testPriorChannels_t1c.cfg](./DeepMedicPlus/examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/test/testPriorChannels_t1c.cfg)

If **no prior volume**, simply put the path to a volume with Zero values only. The zero-value volume we used is shared here named "!!AAZero_Volume.nii.gz".

#### Data preprocessing pipeline  
In order to directly apply our pretrained models, your test data should have the same [preprocessing pipeline](./Brain_MRI_Preprocessing_pipeline/) as ours.
Hopefully your MRI sequence is also T1 MPRAGE or other similar T1 sequences.
Otherwise, the performance of using our pretrained models will be suboptimal, due to different image styles.

#### Command line for inference/test with pretrained models
```python
python deepMedicRun -model ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/model/modelConfig_wide1_deeper.cfg -test ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/test/testConfig.cfg -load ./examples/output/saved_models/deepMedicWide1.high_sensitivity.model.ckpt -dev cuda0
```
```python
python deepMedicRun -model ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/model/modelConfig_wide1_deeper.cfg -test ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/test/testConfig.cfg -load ./examples/output/saved_models/deepMedicWide1.high_precision.model.ckpt -dev cuda0
```

For Windows users, you can also use [runCMDs.py](./DeepMedicPlus/runCMDs.py) to run multiple commands.

### Training new models for your own data
1. Preprocess the data with either your own preprocessing pipeline or [ours](./Brain_MRI_Preprocessing_pipeline/).
2. Put your training data paths in the config files of [.\examples\configFiles\deepMedicPlus\train](./DeepMedicPlus/examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/train/). Put the volumes, labels, brain masks, and prior volumes into trainChannels_t1c.cfg,  trainGtLabels.cfg,  trainRoiMasks.cfg, and trainPriorChannels_t1c.cfg, respectively.
3. In [trainConfigwide.cfg](./DeepMedicPlus/examples/configFiles/DeepMedicPlus/train/trainConfigwide.cfg), Line 62: please add a new numberOfEpochs value.
5. Change the $\alpha$ parameter mannualy in [cost_functions.py](./DeepMedicPlus/deepmedic/neuralnet/cost_functions.py), for example, 0.995 for high sensitivity and 0.5 for high precision. (Sorry that haven't made it available in the args input yet). 
7. Run the command for training
```python
python deepMedicRun -model ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/model/modelConfig_wide1_deeper.cfg -train ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/train/trainConfigwide.cfg  -dev cuda0
```
8. For fast training, you can fine tune our pretrained model with your own training data with the following command:
```python
python deepMedicRun -model ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/model/modelConfig_wide1_deeper.cfg -train ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/train/trainConfigwide.cfg  -load ./examples/output/saved_models/deepMedicWide1.high_sensitivity.model.ckpt -dev cuda0
```
```python
python deepMedicRun -model ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/model/modelConfig_wide1_deeper.cfg -train ./examples/configFiles/deepMedicPlus/train/trainConfigwide.cfg  -load ./examples/output/saved_models/deepMedicWide1.high_precision.model.ckpt -dev cuda0
```
   In [trainConfigwide.cfg](./DeepMedicPlus/examples/configFiles/DeepMedicPlus/train/trainConfigwide.cfg), Line 62: please add a new numberOfEpochs value,  for example, 80, then additional 30 epochs will be trained.
   
## Our System Environment
numpy version:1.19.5    it seems that there is compatibility problems with the latest numpy versions.

We run our codes in a Windows system with Python 3.7, CUDA 11.0; Higher versions should be okay.

## Acknowledgments
Our implementation is mainly based on [DeepMedic](https://github.com/deepmedic/deepmedic).
